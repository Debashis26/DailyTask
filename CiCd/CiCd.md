## Introduction to Ci/Cd

**Ci- Continous integration**  
**Cd- Continous delivery**  


1. CI/CD is a technique that enables quick software development. <br><br>    
2. CI stands for **"Continous Integration"**, it is a practice where developers push the code to a central repository and perform **automation testing**.<br><br>
3. First developers develop the code in the dev environment and then push the code to GitHub or any central repository. Then perform automation testing. If any problem is detected then again developers do the required modification. If the code passes the testing then it is ready for deployment.<br><br>
4.  CD stands for **"Continous  Delivery"** which starts after the *CI* to make sure that we can release error-free software for the customers.

**Some CI/CD tools are :- Jenkins, GitLab, and AWS CodeDeploy**
